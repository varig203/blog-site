                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>I have finally created the new blog site. Still needs a little tweaking but, I have made it atleast.</p>
                    <h3>Why did it take so long?</h3>
                    <p>Well, I originally was wanting to make the site in React and I slowly realized that it will be overkill. I then waited until I was at BCIT in COMP 1850 to actually make it. It surprisingly was quicker to make then I imagined originally. I thought it was gonna take forever to be honest.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I also was dabbling in other things in the time like making a Minecraft mod as a joke. It was meant to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SomeOrdinaryGamers">the Youtuber Mutahar</a> where I only made an awful model. Said awful model could be considered lost media as I cannot find it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I also was upgrading my PC like I bought a new AIO for my PC to get temperatures lower than before. From 50°C to 38°C idle temperature which I would say is pretty good for an small form factor PC and Ryzen 9 7900x.</p>

                    <h3>What's next?</h3>
                    <p>I have this cool idea to make a game in C++ and Vulkan with no engine. Why? I admittedly struggle with GUI heavy applications like game engines so why not make a game without an engine and see where I go.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The game I am thinking of would likely be inspired by Minecraft for it's voxel world and all, but I take some inspiration from mods like <a href="https://gregtech.mechaenetia.com/">GregTech</a> and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create">Create</a>; I also plan to take some inspiration from the intuitive design of many <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/232/Valve_Complete_Pack/">Valve games</a>.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I have another idea like the previous blog about operating systems but I just aim for trying to be as user friendly as possible and that's it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>That's about it for me and there is no definite future to be honest. I will just make what I can and update this blog with whatever I make that's worth sharing.</p>
