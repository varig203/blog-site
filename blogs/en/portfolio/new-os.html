                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>I am currently designing a new OS. Why you may ask? I am tired of all distros and OSes lack of care for the user experience.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>MacOS tries, but there are some inconsistencies which appear to have been there since the start of it. Windows? I don’t really have to explain but it is mainly profit driven with little care of the user or the privacy of said user.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Linux? That’s my base, sure; but even there are huge flaws. Most distros fall apart at the desktop environment layer.</p>
                    <h3>Why the desktop environment?</h3>
                    <p>Let’s take KDE for example pretty powerful yeah; but from the perspective of an average user, it can be pretty overwhelming. Many toggles, options, and modules; it quickly becomes a chaotic/messy experience. (For reference, I last used KDE around version 5.25.)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Then there’s GNOME, sleak and clean by default, but requires tons of extensions to fully customize it how you want it, and overwhelming again for the average user to need to know how extensions work or sometimes break the desktop.</p>
                    <h3>What I am building</h3>
                    <p>I am likely gonna start building a Void Linux-based distro using a custom desktop environment I am going to create entirely from scratch. It’ll be powered by Wayland and written in C++ most likely</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The project is likely going to be called Andromeda OS as a whole and the Desktop Environment will be called Andromeda Desktop Environment, or just ADE for short. My inpirations for this are that I just like astronomy.</p>
                    <p>The goal? A desktop that’s clean, consistent, and designed for average people, not just developers or corporations.</p>
                    <h3>Why C++?</h3>
                    <p>Now this is a rewritten version of the original article removing Rust. Why? I learnt to dislike Rust as C++ is more simple for me.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I also like the more simple and less complex style of C++ where I am not forced to write in a specific way. Java and Rust are great example of forcing you to write in their own way.</p>
                    <h3>Where’s it at?</h3>
                    <p>It currently has years worth of planning due to school and some procrascination not letting me start. It originally started as a plan with full custom kernel but I realized it was too ambitious for a solo dev.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This blog will serve as a devlog, I will try to post updates and progress as much as I can but no promises. Life happens.</p>
                    <h3>Who’s behind this?</h3>
                    <p>Just me. One dev. No team. No funding. No startup. Why you may ask? Well it's just a passion project to me like many things I make.</p>
