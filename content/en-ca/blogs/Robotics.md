I started doing Robotics in Grade 9, just because it sounded like a fun course and I loved the idea of being hands on with my code. It began with a curiosity which quickly progressed into a passion — and by now, 3 months before graduation, I had spent 3 years in Robotics and 4 years Programming.

# Year by year
## Grade 9 - Getting Started
- Used VEX V5 block coding as a start for my programming journey.
- I learnt basic programming and basic understanding of robots.
- My role for the team was everything I built, journaled, programmed, and designed the robot.
## Grade 10 - A Better Understanding
[Github Repository](https://github.com/varig203/6408L)
- Transitioned to using PROS VEX V5 with C/C++.
- Learned the fundamentals of C/C++ in just under 2 weeks.
- My role shifted to primarily programming, with light assistance in building the robot.
## Grade 11 - Break Year
- Focused on expanding my programming knowledge.
- Discovered my passion for low-level programming and systems programming.
- Began to learn the basics operating system theory.
- Advanced my C/C++ skills by diving into multithreading, memory management, and libraries.
## Grade 12 - Breakthrough Year
[Github Repository](https://github.com/varig203/6408S)
- Joined the Robotics club to compete within B.C. (British Columbia).
- Played a key role in two teams due to a mid-season switch.
- Programmed both robots from scratch and assisted with code cleanup and refactoring.
- Developed an Autonomous Selector and enabled the ability to load images onto the robot’s brain without using an SD card.

Moving forward, I plan to further deepen my knowledge in systems programming and mathematics, as I aim to create operating systems.
