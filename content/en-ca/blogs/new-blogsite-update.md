# Why the update?

I have decided to not use React as I have realized that this is overkill, especially for a simple blog site/portfolio. I believe React is better suited for a dynamic site rather than a static site, I have decided to use something else entirely.

# What are you switching to?

I am switching to just pure HTML/CSS/JS. The reason for this is that, I do not need everything in React. I also just want to expand my front end web development skills without overwhelming myself.

# Release date?

Again, like last time I do not know. Not my biggest priority especially with university now. This site has been practically dead since summer this year, and I have been wanting to update it for a while.
