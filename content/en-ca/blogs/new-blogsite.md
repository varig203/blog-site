# Introduction
Currently this site is using Hugo and well, I dislike how I have to use it's constraints. Yes it looks good but I don't like needing to use it's systems so I am switching this site to React.

# Why?
Hugo is a static site generator but it has it's limitations and I want to learn something new which is JS. Now, I dislike JS but it is nice to learn something new. 

# Advantages 
The advantages I would get with React would be that I have full flexibility on how the site looks and is layed out. I personally would love to have a liquid glass like blue on the header of the page with refraction. I understand it is overkill for a blogsite but I love having beautiful sites.

# Disadvantages
Of course I would have to learn a whole new language which means updates to it would be slower, but that's fine as long as I learn new things. Another thing is that I like in Hugo that content is auto added to the page without much effort but I would think I can do something similar with the build process in React. 

# Design
I plan for the site to have [Nord colour scheming](https://www.nordtheme.com/) as I like it's colder looking colours and I use it in my Linux rice. I do also plan the aforementioned apple liquid glass like blur in the header.

# When is the release?
In the upcoming future as it isn't high priority on my list of things. Again it is mostly just a refactor and won't change the sites functionality. It's entire goal is to make the site how I envision it and not how Hugo decides it to be.
